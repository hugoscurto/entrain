 * Interface for the server `'sync'` service.

 * __*The service must be used with its [client-side counterpart]{@link module:soundworks/client.Sync}*__
 *
 * **Note:** the service is based on [`github.com/collective-soundworks/sync`](https://github.com/collective-soundworks/sync).

 * // inside the experience constructor
 * this.sync = this.require('sync');
 * // when the experience has started
 * const syncTime = this.sync.getSyncTime();
