# sync

> Module that synchronises all clients to a server master clock. 

Each client has access to a logical clock that synchronizes to the server clock. The module also provides helper functions that allows to convert the master clock, to and from, the local clock. Everybody can use the common master clock to schedule synchronized events. A good practice is to convert to local time at the last moment to trigger events, in order to avoid drift.

## Install

```sh
npm install [--save] collective-soundworks/sync
```

## Example usage

see [`./examples`](./examples) folder

## Caveats

The synchronisation process is continuous: after a call to the `start`
method, it runs in the background. It is important to avoid blocking
it, on the client side and on the server side.

In many cases, running the sync process in another thread is not an option as the local clock will be different accross threads or processes.

2016],  that describes the synchronisation process in
details, with measurements.
